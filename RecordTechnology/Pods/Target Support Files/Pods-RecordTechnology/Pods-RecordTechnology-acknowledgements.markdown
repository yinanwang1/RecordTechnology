## FMDB

If you are using FMDB in your project, I'd love to hear about it.  Let Gus know
by sending an email to gus@flyingmeat.com.

And if you happen to come across either Gus Mueller or Rob Ryan in a bar, you
might consider purchasing a drink of their choosing if FMDB has been useful to
you.

Finally, and shortly, this is the MIT License.

## LuaViewSDK

GNU GPL

GNU General Public Licence (GPL) 有可能是开源界最常用的许可模式。GPL 保证了所有开发者的权利，同时为使用者提供了足够的复制，分发，修改的权利：

可自由复制
你可以将软件复制到你的电脑，你客户的电脑，或者任何地方。复制份数没有任何限制。
可自由分发
在你的网站提供下载，拷贝到U盘送人，或者将源代码打印出来从窗户扔出去（环保起见，请别这样做）。
可以用来盈利
你可以在分发软件的时候收费，但你必须在收费前向你的客户提供该软件的 GNU GPL 许可协议，以便让他们知道，他们可以从别的渠道免费得到这份软件，以及你收费的理由。
可自由修改
如果你想添加或删除某个功能，没问题，如果你想在别的项目中使用部分代码，也没问题，唯一的要求是，使用了这段代码的项目也必须使用 GPL 协议。
需要注意的是，分发的时候，需要明确提供源代码和二进制文件，另外，用于某些程序的某些协议有一些问题和限制，你可以看一下 @PierreJoye 写的 Practical Guide to GPL Compliance 一文。使用 GPL 协议，你必须在源代码代码中包含相应信息，以及协议本身
